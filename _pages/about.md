* I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/">Spoken Language Systems (LSV)</a> group and member of the <a href="https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/">Saarbr√ºcken Graduate School of Computer Science</a> at the  <a href="https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/">Saarland Informatics Campus</a> working on natural language processing. I am advised by Prof. Dr. Dietrich Klakow. 
* I have obtained my MSc degree in Computer Science from Saarland University. My thesis focused on enriching self supervised neural machine translation using phrases.
* My research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing (NLP), particularly in NLP for low resource languages, Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Information Extraction, Question Answering Systems and Representation Learning.
* I received my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science from Bowen University, Nigeria. My undergraduate research advisors are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Olajide-Adeosun">Dr. O.O. Adeosun</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_SJ0QOoAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. O.A. Ibitoye</a>.
